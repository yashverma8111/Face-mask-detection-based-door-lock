# Face Mask Detection and Door Lock System

This project utilizes computer vision and hardware control to create a system that detects face masks and automatically locks a door if a mask is not worn correctly.

## Key Features:

Real-time face mask detection using MediaPipe Face Detection: Accurately identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
Hand detection for gesture control: Allows users to interact with the system without touching a physical interface.
Hardware integration for door control: Connects to a door mechanism to lock or unlock it based on mask detection results.
Visual feedback and alerts: Provides clear visual cues on screen to indicate mask status and door state.
## Prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or later
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Necessary libraries for hardware control (e.g., controller.py for door automation and LED, Haarcascade files)
